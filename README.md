[Live Demo](https://todoz-zk.vercel.app/)


This is the frontend of my **NestJS + PostgreSQL** [project](https://github.com/zeiadkh/todo-list-backend/blob/master/README.md)
, developed using **React.js**, **Redux**, **Material UI (MUI)**, and **TypeScript**. The goal of this frontend is to provide a clean, responsive user interface that interacts with the backend API built with NestJS.

## Project Overview

This is the frontend counterpart to my NestJS backend project. It serves as the user-facing part of the application and consumes the API provided by the backend. The app has been built to showcase my skills with **React**, **Redux** for state management, **Material UI (MUI)** for design, and **TypeScript** for type-safe code.

## Technologies Used

- **React.js** - A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Redux** - State management library for managing application-wide state.
- **Material UI (MUI)** - A React component library that implements Google's Material Design.
- **TypeScript** - Strongly-typed JavaScript for enhanced development experience.
- **Axios** - For making API requests to the backend.
  
## Features

- Responsive and clean UI built with Material UI.
- State management with Redux and Redux Thunk.
- Full TypeScript support for better code maintainability.
- RESTful API integration with the backend (NestJS).
- Basic forms and data display components.

## Future Enhancements
- Implement a feature to set reminders for tasks with due dates.
- Users should receive notifications or emails for upcoming tasks.
- Allow users to share tasks or collaborate on projects.
- Implement user-to-user task assignment.
